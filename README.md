# LEARNING HOW TO MAKE ALL TYPES OF SIMULATIONS
- As I go through my coding journy to understand and learn how all types of algorithms work, I had stubbled upon my most exciting challenge
- I've started learning physics in the University of Central Flordia and found all types of projections and simulations in physics to be interesting
- Here I will start to show my true pation in computer science and coding through my skills

## Physics simulation
### Gravity/ Solar System/ Slingshot simulation
- I learned how to simulate gravity in space from [this python tutorial about gravity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTfwhmHVpqM)
- As this video had kickstarted my journy I began work on my most recent project about the Solar System
  
THIS VIDEO IS A GREAT DEMONSTRATION:
